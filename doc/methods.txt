============================

1. Written in /bin/get.[method-name], e.g. /bin/get.rsync

2. Environment variables:

   $TARGET       from /pkgs/[package]/target
   $SOURCE       from /pkgs/[package]/source
   $PKGDIR       is /pkgs/[package]
   $STEPFILE     is /log/sync/[package]/[timestamp]/step.txt

3. Stdout and Stderr are automatically redirected to

   /log/sync/[package]/[timestamp]/sedot.log


Some methods:

1. rsync

   Do rsync twice. The second rsync deletes missing files (--delete-after).

2. rsync.debian

   Suitable for Debian (or its derivatives) repository. 
   Syncronize pool/ first and then the rest.

3. custom

   Calls /pkgs/[package]/sync.
